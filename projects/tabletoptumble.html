                        <p>For GMTK 2024 me and a team of 6 others made tabletop tumble. <br>
                            A deck building card game in which u use the cards to build a tower. <br> For this I made
                            most of the gameplay systems together with 1 other programmer.

                        <h2>My Role and teamwork</h2>
                        <p>I worked together on this project with 8 other people (2 of which abandoned the project after
                            a day). <br>Which meant we had to have really good collaboration to make something good.
                            <br><br>

                            We planned ahead our ideas and structure using miro and split our team into different
                            disiplines. <br> <br>

                            We used a self hosted perforce server for collaboration, The others had never used perforce
                            before so I also made a reference doc to make sure everything worked correctly and everyone
                            knew how to work in it Perforce document [Google drive]

                            <h2>Modular systems</h2>
                            <p>I made a modular card system using unity's scriptable objects which allowed for adding
                                cards
                                super easily.<br><br>
                                All cards derive from base systems so you can just add specific behaviour and don't have
                                to
                                manage a lot of system interactions at once when adding a card. <br><br>

                                I made a very similar system for the card effects and the end of turn events. <br><br>

                                I also made procedural animations for the cards in your hand so it feels nice to grab a
                                card.

                    <p>Example code for the freeze effect. <br> This is easily selected in a scritable object with its
                        details to create a card. <br>This made it easy for our designer to add cards or tweak their
                        descriptions or appear chance.</p>

                        <h2>Rope graphics</h2>
                        <p>One of the effects in this game is connecting objects using a rope. <br>
                            Fully physical ropes can be very demanding to calculate (especially in a webGL build)
                            <br><br>

                            So I opted for using a approximation of a rope using a hyperbolic formula. <br>

                            This system is based on another implementation for the game "Sea of Thieves" from this talk
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9BOz2dFZzs&t=1583s" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener">[YouTube: Sea of Thieves talk]</a> <br>

                            I translated the formula into the environment of our project, which was more work than
                            expected since the talk only shows psuedocode and does not deal with the correct scaling and
                            movement translation of the line in an actual environment. <br><br>

                            This formula also only approaches the solution to the problem. <br>With more iterations the
                            formula works for closer distances, that is why i dynamically scale the iterations based on
                            object distance.<br>
                            However there is still a limit to the formula and it still breaks when
                            object are directly above each other. <br>
                            That's why I change to a simpler formula when closer
                            which uses bezier curves to approximate the rope shape
                        </p>
