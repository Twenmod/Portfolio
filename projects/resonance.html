                        <p>For BUAS block D I worked together with a team of 4 Artists, 3 Designers a producer and 2
                            other programmers <br><br>
                            We had to create a game that was loosely based on the game: "Ape out"<br>
                            I also had to implement a Research project for which I chose <i>Fog rendering/Fluid
                                physics.</i><br><br>
                            This project also got awarded: <br><b>"Best Y1 Design"</b> at BUaS awards <br><br>
                            And got nominated for: <br><b>"Best Student Game"</b> at the <b>Dutch Game Awards 2025</b>

                            <p>As the research project I looked into fog rendering, I discussed the best
                                ways/expectencies with my designers and artists<br>
                                The designers found it important that this fog should be very interactive and react to
                                the player to give more impact.<br>
                                The artists wanted it to be subtle and dark to add to the noir vibe of the game,<br>
                                and wanted it to have good control to tweak visuals<br><br>

                                Based on this I decided that the fog should have fluid/smoke physics to be
                                interactable,<br>I also researched some rendering techniques, <br>and opted to test a
                                hybrid approach of depth based fog and particles since performance was a main concern
                            </p>

                                For this I tested out multiple techniques, <br>starting with basic stam fluids on a
                                grid. <br>Eventually I settled on using PIC fluid physics

                                <p>Since performance was a main concern since our lighting is very dynamic (and thus
                                    expensive). <br>The fog could not take up much of the frame time.<br>So for
                                    rendering I settled on a particle based approuch since I already have PIC
                                    particles.<br>Per (visible)particle I render to a mask that is used to mask a depth
                                    based fog, <br>This mask drawing has a lot of control for making the fog merge and
                                    have more detail. This makes it so its not too obvious that its particles without

                                <p>Our designers asked me if it would be feasable to have a fog of war system, <br>I
                                    think it was so I implemented a fog of war system, which shadows visibility behind
                                    walls.<br>
                                    Because of the limited time I opted for a simple solution that requires no extra level design work. <br><br>
                                    
                                    I shoot rays in a circle that try to search for corners, <br>
                                    With the result of that I draw a screen space mask for visibility.<br>
                                    I then do a lot of processing and masking to make sure walls still show up considering our special perspective.
