                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>For BUAS block A we needed to recreate the original metal gear in C++. <br>
                            We were also not allowed to use any standard library features for this project. <br>
                            For this remake I wanted some extra challenge so I decided to add a 2D pathtracer to the
                            project.
                            <br><br>
                            I'll only talk about the raytracer here.

                        <h2>First attempt | Lighting</h2>
                        <p>First I tried to implement this in the 3D way, by sending a ray from every pixel on the
                            screen, <br>
                            I chose this since I thought it would give a more realistic effect and more
                            uniform noise. <br>
                            However after I implemented this I found out this technique would be way
                            slower in this case and give way more noise. <br>
                            In 2D rays cannot miss the camera so
                            sending rays from the light source did make more sense

                        <h2>Iteration | Lighting</h2>
                        <p>After switching to rays from the light source things worked way nicer. <br>
                            I then started to iterate over the concept. <br> <br>
                            First i just had simple rays, Then to reduce the noise I sampled them over time as a form of
                            temperal denoising. <br> <br>
                            I then made the rays refract and leak into
                            walls when they hit them so walls are also correctly lit.<br>
                            Then for these wall collisions I
                            added a heightmap to the walls to add a realistic height effect.

                        <p>While this gave a good looking effect but it was relatively slow. <br> <br>
                            So I multithreaded the solution since this is a perfect case for multithreading. <br>
                            While multithreading worked great I wanted more rays. <br>
                            So I ended up porting it even to the GPU using a compute shader which made it run really
                            fast
